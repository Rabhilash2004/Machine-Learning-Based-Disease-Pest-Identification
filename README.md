# Machine-Learning-Based-Disease-Pest-Identification
ML-based Android system designed to help arecanut farmers by enabling real-time disease and pest identification. Uses CNN and decision tree models (hybrid) with a Flask server to analyze plant images and provide remedies. This is a funded academic project; source code cannot be shared, so only result screenshots from the developed app are uploaded.

This project is developed to assist arecanut farmers in identifying diseases and pests at an early stage using a machine learning–based Android application. The system analyzes plant images and provides real-time diagnosis and remedies through a server-based architecture

Diseases & Pests Covered : Totally 9 diseases were covered in this project which are listed below

1.Ganoderma (Basal Stem Rot)
2.Leaf Spot (Chukki Roga)
3.Kole Roga (Fruit Rot)
4.Inflorescence Die Back
5.Inflorescence Caterpillar
6.Red & White Mites
7.Root Grubs 
8.Spindle Bug 
9.Scale Insects
Including Healthy leaf detection

The dataset used in this project was entirely collected by the we project team members through direct field visits, ensuring real-world relevance and authenticity. No public or online datasets were used. All images were captured under natural plantation conditions to reflect the actual challenges faced by arecanut farmers.

The Android application is designed to assist arecanut farmers in identifying diseases and pests in real time. Users can capture plant images using the mobile camera or upload them from the gallery. The app sends images to a Flask-based server, which processes them using trained ML models and returns disease predictions with recommended remedies. The app features a simple, farmer-friendly interface with Kannada language support for better accessibility.

This project was financially supported by the college management with a grant of ₹44,000 and further funded by JNNCE NewGen IEDC with an additional ₹10,000 for server deployment and related infrastructure support.

As this is a funded academic project, the source code cannot be made publicly available. Only result images and application outputs are shared in this repository.

Note: The images uploaded in this repository are screenshots taken from the developed Android application. As a result, the image quality and resolution may appear lower than the original captured images.
